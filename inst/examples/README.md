About
================

TnT is a R package that wraps the [TnT javascript libraries](https://github.com/tntvis) to provide track-based visulizations from R. It depends on a number of bioconductor packages and is useful for displaying genomic features (as a simple genome browser).

This site contains various examples to demonstrate usage of the package. You are more than welcome to help improve these examples by opening an [issue](https://github.com/Marlin-Na/TnT/issues) or pull request at <https://github.com/Marlin-Na/TnT/tree/master/inst/examples> .
