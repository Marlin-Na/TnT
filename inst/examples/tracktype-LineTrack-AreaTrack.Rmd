title: "Line Track and Area Track"
---

Line Track is created from a series of points in the track (i.e. width-one GRanges and their height).
These points are applied a __tension__ to smooth the connections between points.

Area Track is similar to Line Track but coloring the area behind the curve.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(TnT)
    library(GenomicFeatures)
})
set.seed(69)
```


## Basic LineTrack Example

```{r}
pos <- IRanges(seq(1, 1000, by = 10), width = 1)
height <- .5 + cumsum(runif(length(pos), min = -.1, max = .1))
height[height >= 1] <- 1
height[height <= 0] <- 0

ltrack <- LineTrack(pos, value = height, color = "blue")
TnTBoard(ltrack)
```

## Basic AreaTrack Example

```{r}
artrack <- AreaTrack(pos, value = height, color = "blue")
TnTBoard(artrack)
```
