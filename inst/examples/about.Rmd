TnT is a R package that wraps the [TnT javascript libraries](https://github.com/tntvis)
to provide track-based visulizations from R.
It depends on a number of bioconductor packages and is useful for displaying genomic
features (as a simple genome browser).

You can find the source repository at https://github.com/Marlin-Na/TnT .
