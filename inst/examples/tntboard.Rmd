title: "TnTBoard and TnTGenome"
---

A TnTBoard stores a list of tracks and show them with the same coordinate.
TnTGenome is just TnTBoard with axis and location label.


```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(TnT)
})
set.seed(42)
```


#### TnTBoard/TnTGenome Options

When constructing a TnTBoard, several options can be optionally provided to control the board, they are:

- view.range: GRanges, to set the initial view range.
- coord.range: IRanges or numeric, to set the cooordinate limit.
- zoom.allow:  IRanges or numeric, to set the limit of extent when zooming in and out.
- allow.drag:  Logical, if FALSE, the board will not be able to move or zoom.

In these options, "view.range", "coord.range" and "zoom.allow"

The following example

```{r}
track <- PinTrack(GRanges("chr12", IRanges(c(1, 213), width = 1)), value = c(3, 6))
TnTGenome(track, allow.drag = F)
```
