# TnT

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Marlin-Na/TnT.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Marlin-Na/TnT)

TnT is a R package that wraps the [TnT javascript libraries](https://github.com/tntvis)
to provide track-based visulizations from R. It depends on a number of bioconductor
packages and is useful for displaying genomic features (as a simple genome browser).

To get started, please read [Introduction to TnT](https://marlin-na.github.io/TnT/articles/introduction.html)
and see various [examples](https://marlin-na.github.io/TnT/examples).

This package is a
[GSoC 2017 project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/project/5521605556961280/overview/) by
Jialin Ma, kindly mentored by Toby Hocking and Miguel Pignatelli,
under the organization of R project for statistical computing. Miguel Pignatelli
is also the author of TnT javascript libraries which the R package relies on.
See the [blog post](http://weblog.marlin.pub/post/tnt/tnt-gsoc17/) for a summary of the project.
